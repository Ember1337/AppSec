# Introduction

Hi. Thanks for coming to my book. I am making this for my personal reference. 

As I was prepping for my Senior / Security Engineer interviews, I found myself looking around for a lot of information and nothing was in one place. This made me lose precious time. This is my take on making everything available in one place. I am by no means a security expert and just a newbie trying to consolidate information into one repo. Please feel free to suggest topics and pages to improve this, thus enabling everyone one place to study and prepare from - Noob or Expert. I will try to keep this page as updated as possible.
